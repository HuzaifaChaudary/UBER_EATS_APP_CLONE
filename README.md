 UBER_EATS_APP_CLONE

 React Native Expo CLI based Uber Eats App Clone having 3 different sides 1) User Side where customer will order 2) Courier/Driver Side where he will track the customer and deliver the product and lastly 3) Admin side based on React Js website where admin will upload the product quantity and its pricing. To PARTICIPATE in this open source project, you have to fix its LOCATION from USER SIDE and DRIVER SIDE. Fix the Longitude and Latitude option from both user and driver location to their 'current' standing location option using any platform e.g Google Map Platform. After completion, You may check it if the product uploaded in Admin portal can be seen on User Side or not and User 's current standing location working or not so that the user should feel bothered when googling and copy pasting its lat and longm, user only use GPS. Pull Request will be accepted for almost every good contributor even if making a little contribution.
